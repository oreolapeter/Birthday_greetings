# Birthday_greetings

This solution is created to send birthday greeting to people on their birthday.

This is the power programmers wield. We can think of an idea and bring such ideas to live.

This is particurlar an interesting solution as it has the capacity to send different messages to multiple people whose birthdays are on the same date.

It takes in data from a responder and store the data for each person in a ditctionary. Each dictionary is afterwards stored in a list.

The two iteration methods i.e. while and for loops are used.
